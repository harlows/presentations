# Write your own

> [Berry & Chew (2008)](https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.waikato.ac.nz/doi/abs/10.1080/00986280802373841) reported that lower performing psychology students closed the achievement gap with their higher performing peers just by generating three questions about course material each week.

# Or get a personal tutor

### Bloom's 2 sigma problem:

# Prompts

`Take the directional terms on page 8 and format them by separating the term and definition with a tab and putting each pair on a new line.`

`Write out the cloze sentences on page 9 with a gap for the answer, add a tab and then the answer. Each complete sentence should be on a new line.`

`Can you write another example in that style?`

- Remember to be polite :-)
